# Kernel_Renyi_Transfer_Entropy

Matlab implementation of the Kernel-based Renyi transfer entropy method proposed in the paper "A data-driven 
measure of effective connectivity based on Renyi's alpha-entropy". 

The script Main.m reproduces the results shown in Figure 2A of the paper for the proposed method (alpha = 2). 
The method itself is implemented in the function kRTE (\functions\kRTE.m).
